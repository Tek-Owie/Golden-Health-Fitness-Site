A trainer is one whose occupation is to guide or instruct people in fitness, exercise, diet, and nutrition routines. Perhaps, the need for a trainer to help keep fit is
underemphasized and it's values are lost. However, being educated while exercising is essential in maximizing effectiveness and reducing risk of injury. 
A personal trainer will teach you everything you need to know about exercising. They will put together the suitable routine for your body type to help you achieve your fitness goals, 
and demonstrate the correct posture for each exercise. Hence, my intention to create a fitness blog is to aid in building a physical and mental culture that will provide vitality 
and relief from daily stress and to impact the spirit of a healthy societal growth.
